# vue-paper-dashboard-typescript

> A Vue.js project with TypeScript support
>
> This project was scaffolded using `vue init cristijora/vue-paper-dashboard-cli` command and added TypeScript support on top of it. By using `--allowJs` compiler option we didn't need to modify the original `.js` files.
